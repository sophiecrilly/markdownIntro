I am a polite, honest and trustworthy person.  I enjoy meeting new people and being able to help them with everyday tasks.  I am very reliable and this is reflected by my good attendance at school.   I believe this attribute is essential in the workforce.  My friendly and positive attitude towards people from all walks of life is also an important quality.  I work well as part of a team and this is shown in my enjoyment and commitment to my fellow team members in the sports teams I have been part of.
